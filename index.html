                        For the first time in his career, Brady ran out at the Gillette Stadium
                        home of the New England Patriots
                        from the away dressing room.
                        Returning to his home of 20 years, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
                        quarterback got one over his former team, as well as former coach Bill Belichick,
                        with a hard-fought 19-17 victory in heavy rain.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Nineteen seasons into his NBA career and with a slew of accomplishments
                        to show for his tenure, Carmelo Anthony's résumé would suggest an automatic
                        featured role for this season's Los Angeles Lakers.
                        However, Anthony, 37, is open to whatever his new team asks of him
                        as he continues to pursue the championship that has eluded him throughout
                        his time in the league.
                        "At this point, man, whatever we need to do, let's do it,"
                        Anthony said following the Lakers' third day of training camp Friday.
                        "It ain't ... 'I can't sit,' and, 'Oh, I want to start,'
                        'I want to come off the bench.' Whatever it is, it is."

                        In the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers will start
                        their attempt to repeat as World Series champs with a wild-card
                        date with the St. Louis Cardinals. Whichever team prevails in
                        that matchup will face the MLB-best San Francisco Giants in the
                        NLDS while the Milwaukee Brewers and Atlanta Braves meet in a
                        division series of their own.
